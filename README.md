## Facebook backend clone

> I had developed this backend study for my semester project last year. I just made some updates and moved it to Github.

### How to run

```bash
# configure config file which is in the /api/config folder
# paste your MongoDB url, your SECRET KEY to sign JWTs, SMTP configs to send mails.

# install dependencies
npm install

# run server
npm run dev
```
